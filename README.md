# Wii.JS
A work-in-progress Wii Menu for the browser. 

# Planned Improvements
* Better splash screens with video functionality
* Settings page that allows for channels to be linked to web pages, saved using LocalStorage
* Music/SFX settings
* Themes

# Known Issues
* Music doesn't start automatically in Chrome because of autoplaying restrictions. Only starts after clicking and exiting a channel.
* Responsiveness and scaling isn't perfect, causing layout issues on some viewport sizes. This will be improved over time.
* Does not work in low-res viewports or smartphones. I'm targeting desktops, so fixing this is low priority for the moment.
* CSS clip doesn't have the greatest browser compatiblity, causing the corners of channel images to bleed outside of the outlines. Observed in Microsoft Edge. I'm exploring alternative options. 
* Oddities with the cursor's shadow transparency have been observed on Chrome OS.
